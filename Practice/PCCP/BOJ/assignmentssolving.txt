Q.
I feel like this problem should be solved with dp. But looking at the input range,
1 <= N <= 1000, 1 <= d <= 1000 and 1 <= w <= 100, this problem seems like it 
should be solved using a greedy method. However I can't think of a correct way
to solve this. How to solve this problem and 
What is a general approach to greedy methods on which variable I 
should choose greedily

A.
🎯 General Greedy Selection Rule ==> [Constraint & Optimization, Input size, Update state
then adjust it to fit constraint (invariant), when is vice versa okay -> When state update
depends on constraint]

When designing greedy, ask:
1️⃣ What [constraint] limits selection?
Here → number of days

2️⃣ What do we want to [maximize]?
→ total score

3️⃣ When conflict happens, what should we discard?
→ the least valuable task

So the greedy variable is:

Keep highest weights, discard smallest when over capacity

Q.
Okay I've followed your suggestion and implemented it as you've said. 
But in my code there are two areas i've highlighted by adding comments. 
If I place heappush at "correct here" the code works fine, but if I put it 
under "wrong here" it gives me inaccurate results. 
This seems like a timing issue and I've seen this pattern often in simulation problems.
What a general rule of thumb to increment or decrement states and the like?

A.
What you're noticing is not just a timing issue — it's about maintaining an invariant.
At iteration i, you want:
Invariant:
heap contains the best feasible set of assignments among the first i tasks.

🔥 The Deep Rule (Very Important)
When maintaining constraints in greedy/simulation:
[Always apply the state transition first, then restore invariants.]

In other words:
1. Apply decision
2. Fix constraint violations

🧩 When Is The Reverse Order Correct?
Only when: 
The condition does not depend on the new state
Or you are checking preconditions before transition

Example: 
if energy <= 0:
    stop
move()
Here checking first is correct because move requires energy.
