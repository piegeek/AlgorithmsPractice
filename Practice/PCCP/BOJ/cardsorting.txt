Q.
Is there a way to solve this by dfs + dp instead of using a queue?

Specifications: ""

A.
🚨 Why DFS + DP Is Fundamentally Wrong Here
This problem is:
Not a shortest-path over small state space
Not interval DP
Not subset DP
Not bitmask DP

Trying DFS+DP would essentially attempt to enumerate all possible full binary trees with N leaves.
Number of full binary trees with N leaves = Catalan(N−1)
≈4^N/N^(3/2)
Still exponential.
