This problem is the classical scheduling problem. Previously I thought this problem
could be solved by using a greedy method on it. Can you solve this problem that way?
Also tell me when line sweeping algorithms like my implementation are useful and the 
keyword I should spot to say that this simulation is a line sweeping algorithm. Also
if there are other methods I should know for simulation problems let me know.

A.
🧠 5. Alternative Greedy Solution (Min-Heap Method)
Another classical greedy solution:

1. Sort intervals by start time.
2. Use a min-heap of ending times. <===== Similar to sorting

For each interval:

If earliest ending ≤ current start → reuse room
Else → allocate new room

Example structure:
import heapq

intervals.sort()

heap = []

for s, t in intervals:
    if heap and heap[0] <= s:
        heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, t)

print(len(heap))

[My Interpretation]
So the idea is should I use line sweep (cafeexpansion.py) or heap (operatingsystem.py)?
Line sweep useful when overlapping intervals
Q. When is using a heap useful over line sweep?

🧩 Mental Model
Use Line Sweep when:
This is counting. ("How many?")

Use Heap when:
This is allocation. ("Which one?")

📌 Another Way to See It
Line sweep = mathematical solution
Heap = simulation solution
