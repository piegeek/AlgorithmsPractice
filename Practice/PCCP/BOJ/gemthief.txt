Q.
This is my greedy implementation of the following problem. I've submitted and got
a time exceeded result. What's a way to improve the performance? I think the
double for loop causes 300000 * 300000 ~= 10^13 so it's getting a timeout

Instead of matching:
for jewel:
    find bag

Always ask:
for container:
    choose best available item

This inversion is the trick.
