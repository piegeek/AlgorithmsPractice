My code results in time exceeded issue. If I try resolving the issue by memoization
the size of the state space is still O(2^n * d) and since n <= 10000 and d <= 10000 
this still seems to be too slow perhaps. Tell me how to improve it. Also is there a 
way to memoize "visited" variable without using bitmask?

A.
🔥 This Is Actually a Greedy Scheduling Problem
This is the classic "강연 스케줄링" (Lecture Scheduling) problem.

3️⃣ Why Greedy Works (Deeper Intuition)
So at every step, the only thing that matters is:
Among all jobs considered so far, keep the best d of them.

[My Interpretation]
Look at the input size; the output specifications say that this is a dp problem
but if the input size seems to be too large think of greedy method
