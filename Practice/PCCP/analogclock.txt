Q.
Okay so I'm trying to simulate the number of times the alarm rang but I'm having
problems with just modeling a given timestamp into a clock position. Converting time units
to degrees on the clock is complicated becuase it involves ratios and modular calculations.
Give me a mental model to deal with what value I should multiply or add and what value to
do a modular expression on and etc. Then I tried determining when two lines meet based
on a mathematic formula f(k-1) * f(k+1) < 0 then overlapped -> But this is not robust 
since the input can be between [k-1, k+1] thus making this method invalid. What is a better
way to determine whether two pointers have intersected? And give me what type of problem this is
whether its 1. Event based simulation, 2. Time step state machine, or 3. Line swee and give 
me a general way to solve these types of problems and a clear mental model.

A. => Solution on iPad
🔎 First: What Type of Problem Is This?
This is:
🔵 Event-Based Simulation (Continuous Time)
+
🟡 Relative Motion / Periodic Function Problem

Nothing meaningful happens between intersection events.
This means:
👉 You should compute intersection times directly.
Not simulate per second.

🚨 Why Your Method Is Not Robust
This is a classic problem:
Sampling continuous motion with discrete steps is unreliable.

📌 Final Classification Summary
| Problem       | Type                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Cafe queue    | Event-based discrete                      |
| Bandage       | Time-step state machine                   |
| Clock overlap | Continuous relative-motion event counting |

Q. Since it's a continuous time motion and can be reduced to a math problem, is there 
a way to solve this by using the bisection method?

A.
🧠 1️⃣ When Is Bisection Appropriate?
Bisection is for solving:
f(t)=0

🧠 2️⃣ What Is Our Equation Here?
t=360k​ / 5.9
No root finding needed.

🧠 4️⃣ The Core Insight
This is not a "root finding" problem.
It is a:
🔵 Periodic event counting problem
Where events occur at regular intervals:
t_k​=kP

🧮 5️⃣ When Would Bisection Make Sense?
If the motion was:

Nonlinear speed
Acceleration involved
Piecewise velocity
Unknown analytical solution

Example:
If angular speed depended on time:
ω(t)=6+sin⁡(t)

Then yes — bisection might be appropriate.
But here speeds are constant.
So equation is linear.

[🏆 Final Answer]
Yes, you can use bisection.

But that would be like:
Using Newton’s method to solve 2x = 10.
Technically possible.
Conceptually wrong.
