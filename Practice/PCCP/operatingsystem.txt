Q. I've tried solving this problem with two methods. First I tried event based simulation
where i had to specify the events and states. The events were relatively clear while 
coming up with relevant states were hard in comparison. I was confused whether I should
include the output state as a state we manage during the simulation. The second method
I've tried is that I've noticed this problem reduces to sorting processes according
to their arrival time and priority(score). However even in this approach finding the 
answer was pretty difficult. Tell me a general way of solving this and these types
of problems.

A. 
🧠 4️⃣ The Core Insight You Were Missing
You asked:
Should output state be part of simulation state?
Answer:
❌ No.
Output is a byproduct.
Never treat output as simulation state.
