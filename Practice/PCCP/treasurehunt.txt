❌ Problem 1: DFS for Shortest Path

This is not how shortest path problems should be solved.

❌ Problem 2: No Memoization on (i, j, shoe_used)

The true state space is:
(m * n * 2)
But your DFS explores exponentially many paths instead of only those states once.

🟢 The Correct Approach: BFS with State
Each state is:
(row, col, shoe_used)

Total possible states:
m * n * 2

🚀 Why BFS Is Perfect Here
Each move costs 1
We want minimum steps
BFS guarantees shortest path

🎯 Final Advice

Whenever you see:
Grid
Minimum time
All moves cost same
One extra state (like key, wall break, power)
Think immediately:
🔥 "This is BFS with state."
