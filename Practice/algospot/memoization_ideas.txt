Case 1: Order doesn’t matter, no duplicates
	State: (visited_set, last) or (visited_set)	

Case 3: Order doesn’t matter, duplicates allowed
	Canonical DP trick: impose artificial order
	State size: O(n * target)
	This is one of the most DP-friendly categories.

Case 2: Order matters, no duplicates
	Many “order matters” problems look like permutations, but actually only depend on:
		- last element
		- visited set
		- some aggregate info

	Example: Traveling Salesman
		- Order matters in the path
		- But future only depends on (visited_set, last_city)

Case 4: Order matters, duplicates allowed
	Question 1:
		- Does the exact sequence matter, or only some aggregate properties?
