laboratory.py -> My solution works, but how to optimize it so it runs in 2 seconds?

robotcleaner.py -> Counting and manipulating room logic mixed up; elegant way to solve? -> Shouldn't separate; 
if countable at the last minute by just by looking at the final state of the board, then we can separate, if not don't

gearrotation.py -> Keep working on solution -> "Decision phase and mutation phase must be separated" -> How code was fixed; Make sure gear is only rotated when polarity == False(pruning) and rotate it in dfs

surveillance.py -> Continue working on -> (v)

dragoncurve.py -> Computational geometry; Matrix for rotating 90 degs?

cubing.py -> Continue solving with help of gpt; gpt solution still wrong

laboratory3.py -> Remark: Generating combinations (Force ordering)

newgame2.py -> Problem comprehension (Check what the problematic input differs from other inputs), typo; How to improve?
